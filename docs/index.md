            <h1>Mitchell Derry</h1>

            <p>
                 My name is Mitchell and im a 19 year old student from Newmarket, Ontario. I enjoy skateboarding, 
                video games, movies and music. I currently have a collection of 13 vinyl record albums ranging 
                from classic rock legends such as Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, to modern R&B artists like Tame
                Impala and the Weeknd.

            <p>
                Im hoping this program will give me the skills I need to work freelance as a multimedia director.
                My ideal job would be to work with online content creators on platforms like Youtube and Twitch.tv.
                I would also enjoy working in advertising and marketing/ branding for small businesses, providing them 
                the service they to get started.
