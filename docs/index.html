                My name is Mitchell and im a 19 year old student from Newmarket, Ontario. I enjoy skateboarding, 
                video games, movies and music. I currently have a collection of 13 vinyl record albums ranging 
                from classic rock legends such as Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, to modern R&B artists like Tame
                Impala and the Weeknd.

                Though I have prior experience coding with Java and Python, Im new to HTML and CSS. Im hoping this 
                program will give me the skills I need to work freelance as a multimedia director. My ideal job would 
                be to work with online content creators on platforms like Youtube and Twitch.tv. I would also enjoy 
                working in advertising and marketing/ branding for small businesses, providing them the service 
                they to get started.
